[verse1]

If you were a teacher, I would fail your class

Take it over and over until you notice me

If you were a waiting room, I would Never see a doctor

I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed

[Verse 2]

I wanna be the power ballad that lifts you up, and holds you down

I wanna be the broken love song, that feeds your misery

And I can wish all that I want, but it won't bring us together

Plus, I know whatever happends to me, I know it's for the be ee hee hee ee ter~
